Preface
is the most ancient civilization of the world and has always been looked upon by the world as a
land of wealth and wisdom. has been credited to have developed, apart from philosophy and
mathematics, science and technology of a very high order, which had attracted scholars from all over
the world. Al-Andalusi, a Spanish scholar in the 11th Century, in his monumental work 'Tabaqat alUmam' had discussed the state of science in different countries. He writes, "The first nation to have
cultivated science is â€¦ is known for wisdom of its people. Over many centuries all the kings
of the past have recognized the ability of ns in all branches of knowledge." Andalusi further states,
"ns, as known to all nations for many centuries, are the metal (essence) of wisdom, the source of
fairness and objectivity. They are the people of sublime pensiveness, universal apologues, and useful
and rare inventions."
's contribution to the march of civilization goes back to several thousand years before the Christian
era. From the Vedas to Upanishads and Gautam - the Buddha and Mahavira - the 24th Jain Tirthankara
and then to Kautilya and Chandra Gupta and down up to the eighteenth century, was respected
for its flourishing economy, trade, commerce and culture. It had an inter outreach from Korea
to Arabia, from Bamiyan to Borobudur and beyond. Before the advent of Britishers, n goods were
interly recognized for their quality and craftsmanship. had a much bigger role and presence
in industry and manufacturing than any nation in Europe or Asia. It had a well-developed banking
system and equally renowned businessmen, along with its financiers, who were contributing to create
a flourishing and progressive economy. According to Sunderland, was also one of the greatest
shipbuilding nations and consequently had an access to inter markets. n prosperity held
the world in thrall. It was this wealth which attracted the foreigners - from Alexander to the Britishers.
Historical records establish the level of progress and prosperity attained by before the advent of
the Europeans. n advancement in mathematics, astronomy, physics and chemistry along with
the biological sciences has been well recognized. was a land of abundance, prosperity, affluence,
a land of sharing and caring living in perfect harmony and peace with the nature. From ancient times
almost all religions practiced in different parts of the world, have existed peacefully in and will
continue to do so. thus provides the most ennobling experience in spiritual co-existence.
recognizes that no nation could chart out its domestic or foreign policies unless it has a clear
understanding about itself, its history, its roots, its strengths and failings. In a highly mobile and
globalized world, it is imperative for a nation to know its roots that provide sustenance to its people.
n freedom struggle, which was inspired by Tilak, Gandhi, Aurobindo, Patel, Bose and others, had
a clear vision of the civilizational consciousness of . These leaders had directed the freedom
movement, keeping the n ways and thoughts in the centre of their action. They had a vision to
reconstruct the political and economic institutions of as a continuum of civilizational consciousness,
which made one country, one people, and one Nation.
After achieving independence, the leaders at the helm of affairs lost the spirit and the vision, which the
freedom movement had evoked. They discarded the vision and adopted the institutional framework of
administration created by the Britishers which was quite alien to 's world-view. It is unfortunate
that these leaders could not comprehend 's inner vitality, which was the main force responsible for
's survival despite several attacks and prolonged foreign rule and thus, failed to rekindle the spirit
of .
2
Even after nearly seven decades of our independence, the country has not been able to discover its
innate vitality, the sense of time and the will to act. As a result, in spite of being the oldest civilization
and a young republic, we are engulfed by a multi-dimensional crisis. A crisis, which has encompassed
all walks of life. The rising disparities, social and communal divide and terrorism leading to a fractured
society, are worsening the situation rapidly. The present crisis is the result of this confusion and
disconnect from the seekings and sensibilities of the people. This is worse confounded by the weak
and spineless leadership of the UPA Government. The tragedy is further heightened by their failure to
diagnose the malady and find the remedy. Instead of creating a socio-economic and political paradigm
of governance drawn from the civilizational consciousness of , the leaders tried to follow whatever
was being practiced in this or that western country.
Thus, we have wasted more than half of a century. Many other countries, even with smaller size and
lesser resources, have surpassed us in development parameters. Another reason for this is that the
Governance in these decades was marred by lack of trust, leading to excessive controls. It was also
marked  by  lack  of  openness  in  Government  and  lack  of  people's  participation.  This  has  led  to
concentration of power in a few hands and lack of transparency breeding corruption and nepotism on
a massive scale. The so-called 'liberalization' came in 1990s, but it was half-hearted. It didn't work
because the rest of the eco-system remained the same. However, the beginning of the 21st century
showed some light under the NDA rule. started being reckoned as an economic superpower. The
six-year rule of NDA had given the Nation many firsts, building an image in the Inter community.
However, many of the hopes, potentials and projects have not been fully realized in the subsequent
years. But after 2004, UPA came into power and the situation started worsening again. We missed a
historic  opportunity once more.
UPA's biggest blow to the n political system is that they have taken out Genuineness from
Governance; Authenticity from Administration. UPA has shown Governance of Enactment, not
Action.It has given an Administration of Entitlement without Delivery. We have become a polity of
Promises, and not Performance. We represent an economy of deficits, a work culture of delays
and an asset base of deficiency.Worse, Congress led UPA has made a global synonym of
Corruption, Scandal and Stagnation. To make it even worse, today, we are passing through total
Decision and Policy Paralysis. Sluggish economic growth, unprecedented price rise and unstable
Currency are its most visible facets.
The following demand urgent solutions; economy including agriculture, energy, environment including
natural  resources,  education  and  health,  employment,  external  and  internal  threats  to  security,
empowerment, Governance, and erosion of moral and societal values.
If has to survive as a nation, which it has to, in order to play its destined role in the comity of
nations, if it has to make its voice heard for creating a peaceful and egalitarian world order, then we
must take up the challenges with urgency and determination and provide proper solutions for them. It
is a pity that we have a demoralized leadership presiding over the state apparatus, which is incompetent
to handle the present problems. What is needed today is to arrive at a consensus about the 'Idea' of
and also to think and redesign our approach in consonance with the seekings and preferences of
the n people.
The situation in the country is deteriorating rapidly. Delay in resolving the crisis would be dangerous.
What is needed is to take lessons from history, recognise the vitality and resilience of , the power
of its world-view and utilize its strength, which drove it to glorious heights and analyse its weaknesses,
which led to this abysmal fall. Pick up the thread from the point where the continuum of our civilizational
3
consciousness was lost and reorient the polity in consonance with those strong points of n
psyche which will be the engine for our future glory. Let's keep the windows open, have a clear
understanding of the global scenario and how without destroying our uniqueness we can assimilate
the best of the technological advancements.
We can achieve this goal provided the leaders seriously set to this task. What we need is a political
party committed to deliver and a leadership with strong determination and political will. As Vivekananda
had said, "All power is within you. You can do anything. Believe in that." Yes, the power lies in the
people of , in the inner sanctum sanctorum of Mother . What is needed is to ignite the spark
and Mother would rise in her full glory.
As Sri Ma had once said that had become the symbolic representation of all the difficulties of
modern mankind but will also be the land of its resurrection to a higher and truer life. The will
leave no stone unturned to fulfill the dream of 1.22 billion ns.
Today, is blessed with the rare capacity and opportunity of Democracy, Demographyand
Demand. If we are able to consolidate and harness them, we will be able to reach the heights which
deserves. The biggest reason for a sorry state of affairs is bad intentions on the part of those who
have ruled the country for sixty years. And that is where we would show the first difference. For 
the goal of the policies and practices would be: Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat!The path would be:
Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.This is our commitment to the Nation and to the People.
With this determination of the party under the charismatic leadership of Shri Narendra Modi, we enter
the elections to the 16th Lok Sabha and would work whole-heartedly to give a stable, strong, visionary
and progressive Government to .
It is an opportunity to change our fate and of our nation.
Glory to Mother , glory to Her children.

Attend the Imminent
Decade under the UPA - I and II can rightly be summed in one line, the 'Decade of Decay', in which
had a free fall on all fronts - be it governance, economy, diplomacy, foreign policy, border safety,
etc. At the same time, corruption, scams and crime against women have reached to unacceptable
levels. There has been gross misuse and total denigration of government and institutions. There has
also been erosion of authority of the office of the Prime Minister. The Government dithered by each
passing day, casting gloom and doom on the country that was once under the NDA regime called the
'Emerging Superpower'. In 2004, NDA left the Government with a near double digit growth. The Congressled UPA could not even maintain that growth and mismanaged the country so badly, that the growth
rate declined to 4.8%, resulting the country falling in a deep mess. We have lost a wonderful opportunity
and have pushed the country 20 years behind and rendered millions of men and women jobless.
Critical and urgent challenges facing the nation have been left unaddressed. Beyond impacting the
immediate short-term, this is corroding the long-term potential of the nation. People feel frustrated and
have lost hope in the system. Things must change, and they must change now. will take immediate
and decisive action to address these issues on a priority basis.
Price Rise
Runaway food inflation has crippled household budgets and contributed to the overall inflationary trend
under the Congress led UPA's watch. Even worse, the food and nutritional security of millions is
threatened. However, the Congress led UPA government has remained insensitive and fferent to the
plight of the people; tying itself into knots with short-term, mis-directed steps. The committee of Chief
Ministers, headed by Shri Narendra Modi, has already submitted a report on food inflation in 2011. The
report was unfortunately not acted upon by the Congress led UPA Government.
The led NDA Government's record of holding the prices is a demonstration of our commitment to
break the vicious cycle of high inflation and high interest rates. Our immediate task will be to rein in
inflation by several steps, such as:
put in place strict measures and special Courtsto stop hoarding and black marketing.
setting up a Price Stabilisation Fund.
unbundle FCIoperations into procurement, storage and distribution for greater efficiency.
leverage on technology to disseminate Real time data, especially to farmers - on production,
prices, imports, stocks and overall availability.
evolve a single' Agriculture Market'.
promote and support area specific crops and vegetables linked to food habits of the people.
Employment and Entrepreneurship
The country has been dragged through 10 years of Jobless Growthby the Congress led UPA
Government. Under the broader economic revival, will accord high priority to job creation and
opportunities for entrepreneurship. We will:
strategically develop high impact domains like Labour-intensive manufacturing(viz. textile,
footwear, electronics assembly, etc.) and Tourism.
strengthen the traditional employment bases ofagricultureand allied industries, and retailthrough modernization as well as stronger credit and market linkages.
5
harness the opportunities provided by the upgradation of infrastructureand housing, for its job
generating potential.
encourage and empower our youth forself-employment - incubating entrepreneurship as well as
facilitating credit.
address the employability issue by initiating a multi-skills development programme in mission
mode. Focus will be on job creation and entrepreneurship, in both rural and urban areas.
transform our Employment Exchangesinto Career Centres - connecting our youth with job
opportunities in a transparent and effective manner through the use of technology; as well as
providing counselling and training.
Corruption
Corruption is a manifestation of poor Governance. Moreover, it reflects the bad intentions of those
sitting in power. All pervasive corruption under the Congress led UPA has become a '
Crisis'.
We will establish a system, which eliminates the scope for corruption.We will do this through:
public awareness
technology enabled e-Governance -minimizing the discretion in the citizen-government interface.
system-based, policy-driven governance - making it transparent.
rationalization and simplification of the tax regime - which is currently repulsive for honest
tax payers.
simplification of the processes and procedures at all levels -bestowing faith in the citizens,
institutions and establishments.
Black Money
By minimizing the scope for corruption, we will ensure minimization of the generation of black money.
is committed to initiate the process of tracking down and bringing back black money stashed in
foreign banks and offshore accounts. We will set up a Task Force for this purpose and to recommend
amendments to existing laws or enact new laws. The process of bringing back black money to 
what belongs to , will be put in motion on priority. We will also proactively engage with foreign
Governments to facilitate information sharing on black money.
Decision and Policy Paralysis
The country has suffered a decade of maladministration and scams in addition to decision and policy
paralysis; thus bringing growth and development to a grng halt leading to a 'Governance deficit'.
This situation will be changed and the engine of Government will be ignited again with strong willpower
and commitment to public interest. We will also encourage the bureaucracy to take right decisions
and contribute their might in building a modern .
Poor Delivery
Wherever we go, we encounter bottlenecks. We experience it on a daily basis - in government offices
for even the simplest of public services, in our courts buried in high pendency and so on. Similarly, we
are known by a culture of missing links and lack of last mile connectivity. We have water but no
pipeline to carry it; we have schools but no teachers; we have computers and machines but no
electricity; we have scientists but no labs; we have instruments but no one to work on them. This
6
reduces the pace of our performance and results into wastage of time, money and energy. Intent to do
the right thing and the will to do things rightly, is missing. This has to be attended to on a priority basis.
Whatever we do and provide for, the whole chain has to be kept in mind. With this in mind,
we will:
remove bottlenecks and missing links in all sectors, activities and services.
focus on proper planning and execution for right outcomes.
strive for scale and speed with futuristic vision.
Build institutions for today and tomorrow.
Credibility Crisis
The biggest challenge that faces today is to restore the credibility of, and trust in the Union
Government. In recent years, the Union Government has lost every semblance of credibility. Its intentions,
integrity and initiatives, all are questionable. The Congress party has not only lowered the dignity of the
Government, but also the dignity of . This is what is driving recent adversities like the falling rupee
and countries riding roughshod over us. The will work for restoring the trust and credibility of the
Government. We will also ensure that the chain of responsibility and accountability is built in the
system.

Strengthen the Framework
Team 
Centre-State Relations
is a diverse country. Diverse communities settled in vastly different regions have their own aspirations.
Taking these aspirations into consideration, the centre and the states therefore have to evolve a working
system, which leads to harmonious relations. The genuine grievances of every state will be addressed
in a comprehensive manner.
We will place Centre-State relations on an even keel through the process of consultation and strive
for harmonious Centre-State relations.
Our Government will be an enabler and facilitator in the rapid progress of states. We will evolve a
model of  development, which is driven by the states.
Team shall not be limited to the Prime Minister led team sitting in Delhi, but will also include
Chief Ministers and other functionaries as equal partners.
Ensure fiscal autonomy of States while urging financial discipline.
Create 'Regional Councils of States', with common problems and concerns, with a view to seeking
solutions that are applicable across a group of states.
We will encourage cooperation among states on security-related issues, inter-state disputes and
for removing inter-regional economic disparities and promoting tourism.
We recognize the special needs and unique problems of the hill and desert states. In consultation
with the Governments of these states, state-specific developmental priorities/ models will be evolved
so that the aspirations of the people are met.
Given the unique status of Union Territories (UTs), they will receive special attention. We will focus
on developing and strengthening the economy of UTs. Tourism will be promoted, tribal welfare and
their rights will receive full attention, and infrastructure and coastal area development will be given
top priority.
We reiterate our commitment to the protection and integrated development of our island territories.
The moribund forums like ' Development Council' and 'Inter-State Council' will be revived
and made into active bodies.
Involve the state Governments in the promotion of foreign trade and commerce.
Help the states mobilize resources through investments in industry, agriculture and infrastructure.
Integrating the Nation - Its Vastness and Voices
In a democracy, everyone is not only free, but also encouraged to voice his or her concerns. It is also
necessary that these voices be heard and concerns redressed. However, all this should happen within
the framework of our constitution and with the spirit of 'First'. We have to keep the Nation at the
forefront of our thoughts and actions. Any activity, which disrupts the integrity of the nation, cannot be
in the interest of any segment of the society or any region of the country. All ns living in different
regions of the country have an equal stake in the progress of the country and they have to be assured
of the fruits of the progress.
Presently, we see that there is a vast regional disparity between different regions of the country
8
along developmental parameters, particularly between the western part and the eastern part.
Despite their richness in both natural as well as human resources, eastern part of still lags
behind.
We shall give the highest priority towards bringing the eastern parts of the country on par with the
western parts. To that extent, there shall be special focus and emphasis on the development of the
eastern side of .
Government will play the role of an enabler and a facilitator to the rapid progress of the states;
planning alongregional aspirations, strengths and potentials, evolving appropriate strategies
for various zones of the country - hilly regions, plains, desert and coastal areas.
Regional aspirations: has always stood for greater decentralization through smaller States.
Northeast : Resource rich North-Eastern states are lagging behind in development due to poor
governance, systemic corruption and poor delivery of public services. NDA government had initiated
concrete steps to address the issue of development of Northeast by setting up the Ministry of NorthEastern Region. We will empower this Ministry with a broader charter and non-lapsable funds for the
rapid development of the region.
will:
put special emphasis on enhancing the connectivity within the region and to the rest of the country.
There will be special emphasis on massive infrastructure development, especially along the Line

healthcare and more job opportunities, leading to a better quality of life in the valley.
Seemandhra and Telangana: is committed to do full justice to Seemandhra, and address the
9
issues of development and governance of Seemandhra and Telangana.
Decentralization and People's Participation
From Representative to Participatory Democracy
is a country of immense diversity - a highly decentralized federal structure is thus crucial in
meeting the varied ideas and aspirations of our diverse people. Power is currently concentrated in
Delhi and the State capitals. We believe this power should be genuinely decentralized. has stood
for greater decentralization through devolving of powers to the states. A vast reservoir of People's
Powerhas not yet been tested in the real sense. We have not been able to involve the people in
Governance as functionaries and facilitators.
People's Participation:Our developmental process will be a people's movement - of Jan bhagidari.
We will make them the active drivers of development rather than mere passive recipients.
People's Engagement:Through Pro-active, Pro-people Good Governance,we will ensure the
Government itself directly reaches out to the people, especially the weak and marginalized sections
of society.
We will further evolve the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model into a People-Public-Private
Partnership (PPPP) model.

Good Governance: Transparent, Effective, Involving and Encouraging

First simply means nurturing and protecting all the elements, which is made of. It does not
exclude anyone or anything - it only includes everything and everyone, which is made of. It is
complete ; without exclusion, without exception. It also means that whatever is in the interest of
will be in the interest of all the elements that is made up of, including its citizens.
The counter to the concept of 'First' is what is happening today; appeasement of one, at the cost
of the other, using Institutions for protecting the interest of a particular party or persons. It is reflected
in the thinking that whatever is not in the interest of a party is not in the interest of . Clearly,
Governance on these lines is not in the interest of .
Simply speaking, 'First' puts the  interest first while taking any decision or step both by
Governments and citizens. Even more simply put, you have to just see the face of and ns
when you are in doubt. This is what separates 'First' from the present day politics and Governance
of the Congress led UPA.
For 
the only philosophy and religion of a Government should be First.
the only epic of a Government should be 's Constitution.
the only power of a Government should be the power of the people.

people and make the Government agencies accountable to the citizens. We will set-up an effective
Lokpal institution. Corruption at any level will be dealt with firmly and swiftly.
From birth certificate to school admission, from setting up business to paying of taxes, our present
systems complicate the lives of our own people. We will reform it and make it easy in terms of access,

Neo-Middle Class - Meet their Aspirations
has a large middle class with immense understanding, talent and purchasing power. In addition,
a whole new class has emerged. Those who have risen from the category of poor and are yet to
stabilize in the middle class, the 'neo middle class'. This class needs proactive handholding. Having
moved out of poverty, their aspirations have increased. They want amenities and services of a certain
standard. They thus now feel that Government facilities and services are not up to the mark, and hence
resort to the private sector for things like education, health and transport. This is obviously costly,
putting the neo middle class into a daily dilemma. As more and more people move into this category,
18
their expectations for better public services have to be met. We have to strengthen the Public Sector
for providing efficient services to our citizens. In particular attention will be paid on government providing:
Educational scholarships and educational facilities.
Medical insurance and quality healthcare services.
Middle-income housing.
Efficient public transport systems.
Rural Areas - High Priority

personal, economic and social well being of the villagers. Through the idea of Rurban, we will bring
urban amenities to our rural areas, while retaining the soul of the village.

Leap Forward

uniform and all pervasive. Further, we have to make the people active partners in whatever is happening
and empower them to take advantage of the development process. We will make an effort that government
withdraws from those services which could be done by others and devote that extra time, money and
energy for social sectors, particularly for development of the weaker sections. And a common thread
will run across all our ideas and initiatives. This common thread is the wire and wave of Technology -maximum application of technology for making governance easy, economical and effective.
Social Security - A Caring Government, Passionate Society

schemes of the Governments have to be made more meaningful. Our aspirations get frustrated when

Government with GDP growth nearing double digit in 2004. Inflation was under control. Fiscal Deficit

fundamentals. In contrast, now at the end of Congress led UPA regime, the GDP growth has plummeted
to very low of 4.8%, the inflation and price rise beyond control, the fiscal deficit and current account
deficit in the alarm zone, and the manufacturing sector facing a recession. The Congress led UPA has
indulged in massive scams during its last five years. In recent years, the n Rupee has seen a free
fall like never before.

simply not taken. And if they are taken, they turn into scandals. All this has destroyed the reputation
of our economy. To reverse this process, the first thing, which is required, is to restore confidencein

the business class and negatively impacts the investment climate, but also dents the image of the
country. realizes the importance of having a Tax Policy Roadmap, so that people are aware of the
future and plan accordingly. We will:

Industry - Modern, Competitive and Caring
We should no longer remain a market for the global industry. Rather, we should become a Global
Manufacturing Hub. We have to encourage our industry to innovate and collaborate interly. We
have to encourage industry to produce efficiently and cost-effectively.
Economic freedom implies that Government will not get in the way of the freedom of viduals to start
and operate legitimate businesses. Increased economic freedom will break open the economic space
to new entrants, especially in the form of small and medium-enterprises, creating jobs and prosperity.

Services - Driven by Quality and Efficiency
Business and Trade
The modern era is an era of exchange. Over-regulation needs to be addressed to stop the harassment
of the businessmen and traders. At the same time, we have to set up transparent systems, which
ensure credibility of our goods and services. At the same time, the bottlenecks in transporting and
exporting them have to be removed. Also, the flow of information about our tradable items has to be
made available to the rest of the world.

creation of jobs, enterprise, infrastructure development, and foreign exchange earnings.
realizes that the tourism sector needs a clear plan for growth, and commits to initiate a
mission mode project to create 50 tourist circuits that are affordable and built around themes like: a.)
Archaeological and Heritage, b.) Cultural and Spiritual, c.) Himalayan, d.) Desert, e.) Coastal, f.)
Medical (Ayurveda and Modern Medicine), etc. This will lead to creation of infrastructure and employment
around each tourist circuit and help in boosting revenue generation.
Specialized course in tourism will be started for capacity development. Safety and Security of tourists
would be accorded due priority.
Labour Force - The Pillar of Our Growth
recognizes the fact that the labour is the key to the revival of the economy and so are the laws
governing them. We believe in promoting a harmonious relationship between labour and the industry,
with both playing an important contributory role in economic growth and development.
We will ensure that the interests of labour in the unorganized sector are protected.
For the organized labour, we propose to encourage industry owners and labour to embrace the concept
of 'Industry Family'. This concept, in which industry owners and labours bond as a family, is guided by
the principles of efficiency, skill development and upgradation, productivity, appropriate wages and
perquisites, and security towards this end. We will:
issue identity cards to the unorganized sector labourers, and arrangements will be made to provide
them good quality health and education services. Also, their skills will be upgraded through
appropriate training programs.

completes 75 years of its Independence, every family will have a pucca house of its own. It will be an
innovatively designed scheme that dovetails various existing programmes and also encourages the
housing sector by appropriate policy interventions and credit availability including interest subventions,
where necessary.
Our proposed programme will further ensure that these houses are equipped with the basic facilities of
toilet, piped water supply, electricity and proper Access. To do this we will amongst others:
Prioritize all our resources towards this goal.
Leverage on land as a resource in urban areas and demand for unskilled labour in the rural areas.
Innovatively structure the programme to converge and dovetail various existing programmes, while
adding the missing links.
Simultaneously encourage the overall housing sector, through appropriate policy interventions and
credit availability and interest subvention schemes.
Physical Infrastructure - Better than the Best
should no longer be limited by its infrastructure. In fact, we have to create robust infrastructure,
which drives growth. For this purpose, we have to devote ourselves for a decade. We have to think big.
Also, looking to the expansion in our population as well as social and economic activities, we have to
build our infrastructure in a futuristic way. Growth of this sector means the growth of cement, steel,
electricity and many other associated industries and directly leads to massive job creation. To achieve
this, we will take following steps.
Work on the Freight Corridorsand attendant Industrial Corridorswill be expedited. This will
result in the faster movement of people and goods.

Flora, Fauna and Environment - Safeguarding Our Tomorrow
The present generation has to make this world a better place to live. A better place not only for us, but
for our future generations as well. We have to nurture the environment, institutions, people, resources
and amenities. We have to combine the past, the present and the future. We have to have a holistic
view of human life for sustainable development.
We have to develop the assets and amenities for ourselves in a manner that leaves an equally good or
even better environment for the future generations. We will put sustainabilityat the centre of our
thoughts and actions, working on the principle that inclusive growth cannot be limited by the barriers of
time and space - it has to be built on the foundations of the past, leverage on the opportunities of the
present, and preserve and enhance its resources for the future. We will take Climate Change mitigation

Natural &  Resources - Use When Required, Protect Where Necessary
n belief has been best encapsulated in Gandhiji's words that "there is enough for everyone's need
- but not for everyone's greed". Need is not the issue. Greed is. A country's progress depends upon its
resources and how they are harnessed and protected. Those in power have to realize they are just
trustees of the resources of the nation. The resources are neither meant for them nor for their masters.
If we bring this basic shift in thinking of the Government, which Mahatma Gandhi also advocated, all
problems will be resolved.
In recent years, it has been noticed that country's tangible and intangible resources have been looted
with impunity. The adverse result is being felt on two sides: Firstly, the proceeds of the resources have
not gone to the public exchequer. Secondly, because of this culture of usurping, the same resources
are not available for public purposes. The management of natural resources is marred with either
misappropriation or misallocation. This has to be set right.
We will set in place  policies on critical natural resources like coal, minerals, spectrum,
etc. - spelling out in black and white how much should be utilized at what time and pace; how this
should be strategically phased out to ensure sustainability; who should be allotted what responsibility
of extraction and at what cost.
State Governments will be taken into confidence for harnessing of these resources.
We will implement auctionof precious resources through efficient mechanisms including eauction.
Resource mapping, exploration and management will be undertaken through the use of technology.
Value additionwill be encouraged in all resources, instead of just marketing.
Secure ns - Zero Tolerance on Terrorism, Extremism and Crime
Comprehensive  security is not just about borders, but in its broad terms includes military
security; economic security; cyber security; energy, food and water and health security; and social
cohesion and harmony. To effectively address the issues of  security, we need to address the
issues of - human resources, science and technology, system of governance and money.
 security cannot be compartmentalized based on one of issues but needs a clear roadmap to
address it. Over the past decade, lack of a strong and visionary leadership, coupled with multiple
power centres, has failed to address the issue of  security, leading to a chaotic situation and
denting 's image in the inter arena.
has a sensitive neighbourhood and there are internal security issues. There have been intrusions
inside the LAC (Line of actual control), loss of squadrons of combat aircraft by the air force, witnessing
of a series of accidents by the Navy, leading to a loss in its combating capability built over many
decades, communal riots, Maoist attacks, increase in incidence of Pakistan backed terror groups in
38
, illegal immigration across the eastern border, and racists' attacks in the  capital. All
these are cations of surrendering of 's interest. This calls for a review and overhauling of the
current system. With the financial situation worsening, the issue of  security can acquire a
horrifying dimension.
recognizes the importance of identifying a clear roadmap to address the issue head-on, with
radical systemic changes.

hardware and platforms for both domestic use and exports, in a competitive environment.
Independent Strategic Nuclear Programme
believes that the strategic gains acquired by during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime on the
nuclear programme have been frittered away by the Congress. Our emphasis was, and remains on,
beginning of a new thrust on framing policies that would serve 's  interest in the 21st
century. We will follow a two-pronged independent nuclear programme, unencumbered by foreign
pressure and influence, for civilian and military purposes, especially as nuclear power is a major
contributor to 's energy sector.
will:
Study in detail 's nuclear doctrine, and revise and update it, to make it relevant to challenges
of current times.
Maintain a credible minimum deterrent that is in tune with changing geostatic realities.
Invest in 's genous Thorium Technology Programme.
Foreign Relations - Nation First, Universal Brotherhood
believes a resurgent must get its rightful place in the comity of nations and inter
institutions. The vision is to fundamentally reboot and reorient the foreign policy goals, content and
process, in a manner that locates 's global strategic engagement in a new paradigm and on a
wider canvass, that is not just limited to political diplomacy, but also includes our economic, scientific,
cultural, political and security interests, both regional and global, on the principles of equality and
mutuality, so that it leads to an economically stronger , and its voice is heard in the inter
fora.
believes that political stability, progress and peace in the region are essential for south Asia's
growth and development. The Congress led UPA has failed to establish enduring friendly and cooperative
40
relations with 's neighbours. 's relations with traditional allies have turned cold. and its
neighbours have drifted apart. Instead of clarity, we have seen confusion. The absence of statecraft has
never been felt so acutely as today. is seen to be floundering, whereas it should have been
engaging with the world with confidence. The collapse of the n economy has contributed to the
sorry state of foreign affairs in no small measure.
We will build a strong, self-reliant and self-confident , regaining its rightful place in the comity of
nations. In this, we will be firstly guided by our centuries old tradition of olq/kSo dqVqEcde~. At the same
