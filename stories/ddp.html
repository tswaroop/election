  <h2>The Doordarshi Party</h2>

  <p class="drop-cap"> Founded by <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_gurudev">Baba Jai Gurudev</a> at
  Ahmedabad in March 1980, the DDP focused on spiritual growth. All candidates
  were expected to be teetotallers and vegetarian.</p>

  <p style="width:180px">The party contested in the 1984 elections at 24 of the
  26 constituencies in Gujarat and 73 of the 85 constituencies in Uttar
  Pradesh. But every single candidate lost their deposit.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">In 1989, the party
  expanded its presence to cover Bihar (47 candidates), Maharashtra (40), Madhya
  Pradesh (30), Rajasthan (24), West Bengal (18), Haryana (10), Delhi (7) and
  also parts of Orissa, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh.</p>

  <p>Given its scale of operations, the DDP was the <em>second largest party</em>
  in the 1989 elections, fielding more candidates than BSP (245), JD (244) and
  the BJP (225).

  <p>The results, however, were exactly the same as before. Every single candidate
  lost their deposit.</p>

<div class="story story-right" style="top:380px">
  <p class="drop-cap">Undeterred, the party tried again two years later,
  fielding even more candidates, extending into all the south states as well as
  Assam. Though 321 candidates contested this election, the party was not the
  second largest in terms of candidates. The BJP (with 477 candidates) and JP
  (with 350) were ahead.</p>

  <p>Again, the results were disappointing. Every candidate lost their
  deposit. In its entire history, no candidate even made it to runner-up,
  nor garnered even 1 out of every 50 votes. Overall, the party received
  less than 1 vote for every 600 voters.</p>

  <p>At this point, the party withdrew from politics. Jai Gurudev continued
  to be active until his death in May 2012 (aged 116 years.)</p>
